== Introduction ==

=== Required Software ===

  * Qt 4.5 ([http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads Download])
  * PyQt 4.5 ([http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download Download])
  * PySerial ([http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyserial/ Download])

Other versions of these packages might also work but are not tested.

Under Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope, might also work for older releases) you only need to to do:

> sudo aptitude install python-qt4 python-serial

which should install all required packages.
