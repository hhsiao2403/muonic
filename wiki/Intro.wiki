== Introduction ==

=== Required Software ===

  * Qt 4.5 ([http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads Download])
  * PyQt 4.5 ([http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download Download])
  * PySerial ([http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyserial/ Download])
  * Qwt ([http://sourceforge.net/projects/qwt/ Download])
  * PyQwt ([http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net/download.html Download])

Other versions of these packages might also work but are not tested.

Under Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope, might also work for older releases) you only need to to do:

> sudo aptitude install python-qt4 python-serial

which should install all required packages except Qwt and PyQwt. The PyQwt packages are broken in the Ubuntu pacakge repository but there are PPAs from where you can install them. You can find the package [https://launchpad.net/~treparel/+archive/ppa?field.series_filter=jaunty here for Ubuntu 9.04] and [https://launchpad.net/~eudoxos/+archive/ppa?field.series_filter=karmic here for Ubuntu 9.10].
