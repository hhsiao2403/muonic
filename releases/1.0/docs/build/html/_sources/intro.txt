muonic - a python gui for QNET experiments
===========================================

The muonic project provides an interface to communicate with QNet DAQ cards and to perform simple analysis of QNet data.
Its goal is to ensure easy and stable access to the QNet cards and visualize some of the features of the cards. It is meant to be used in school projects, so it should be easy to use even by people who do not have lots of programming or LINUX backround. Automated data taking can be used to ensure no valuable data is lost.
