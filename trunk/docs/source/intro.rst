===========================================

The muonic project provides an interface to communicate with QuarkNet DAQ cards and to perform simple analysis of the generated data.
Its goal is to ensure easy and stable access to the QuarkNet cards and visualize some of the features of the cards. It is meant to be used in school projects, so it should be easy to use even by people who do not have lots LINUX backround or experience with scientific software. Automated data taking can be used to ensure no valuable data is lost.
